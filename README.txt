ascii-art

Ascii-art is a program which consists of receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII. 
What we mean by a graphic representation using ASCII, is to write the string received using ASCII characters.
This project handles input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters and \n.


For example in the command line -  

go run . "hello"

 _              _   _          
| |            | | | |         
| |__     ___  | | | |   ___   
|  _ \   / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  
| | | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) | 
|_| |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/
